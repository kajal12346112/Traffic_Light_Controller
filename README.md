# Traffic_Light_Controller

This Verilog project simulates a traffic light controller for a 4-way intersection using an FSM with six states. It manages signal transitions for Main Roads , Turning , and Side Road. 

The design cycles through timed states using a counter and outputs Red, Yellow, and Green signals as 3-bit encodings. 

A testbench is provided to simulate functionality and observe transitions.
